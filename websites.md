# Websites

The two websites I spent the majority of my career building, creating, and maintaining were the Pensacola Christian College's website, which is made up of over 250 static pages and many more dynamic pages.

## Process

### Research
I started my redesign by doing straight up research. I spent 6 out of the 18 months (alongside my other projects and regular site maintenance) just researching. I studied accurate mental models for my targeted age group, good UX, and much more. I organized my data in excel documents with links and screenshot examples of what I planned to use.

I also set up the hierarchy of data on each page. I studied heat maps of the current site to see the most commonly selected areas so that we could emphasize that data for the new site. We did a lot of student surveys from existing students and from random surveyors online. Once data was completed, then we started the fun stuff.

### Wireframes
I started on paper making my wireframes so I could get a picture of the rhythm, layout, and composition of the site. I later moved those onto the computer and begun thinking about mobile transitioning into desktop. We knew this site needed to be fully responsive, so we had to tackle any design challenges that came along with that. Wireframing is the best time to do that because you're working in literal empty boxes and circles.

### Prototypes
I started my prototype process by simply stacking together my research. I layered screenshots of my inspiration on Photoshop (this was before working in Figma and Adobe XD) so that I could get a feel of the rhythm of the page. After that, I started to design my elements piece by piece. A little tip, one of my favorite books on inspiration is [Steal Like An Artist](https://austinkleon.com/steal/) which is revolutionary in any design.

### Development
I didn't get the chance to save my work before I left that position (thinking that I would keep that job forever!) So the only examples I have to show you are the final products.
